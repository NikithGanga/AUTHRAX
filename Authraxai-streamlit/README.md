# AUTHRAX AI Streamlit Interface
Welcome to AUTHRAX AI, an advanced conversational agent designed to interact with PDF documents through natural language. This project is built on the Streamlit framework, providing an intuitive user interface for seamless interaction with AI-powered PDF chatbots.

Overview:
AUTHRAX AI leverages cutting-edge language models to enable users to engage in dynamic conversations with a chatbot that can reference and extract information from multiple PDF documents. The application is designed to simplify the process of obtaining information from PDFs, making it more efficient and user-friendly.

Key Features:
->PDF Text Extraction: Utilizes robust algorithms to read and extract text from multiple PDF documents, consolidating the content into a single corpus for analysis.

->Text Chunking: Implements a character-based text splitter to divide the extracted text into smaller, manageable chunks, enhancing processing efficiency.

->Text Embeddings: Employs OpenAI's text embeddings to transform text chunks into numerical representations, facilitating similarity analysis and information retrieval.

->User Interaction: Allows users to input queries related to the content of the uploaded PDF documents, with the chatbot providing informed responses based on the PDF content and conversation history.

->Streamlit Interface: Offers a user-friendly interface for uploading PDF documents, posing questions, and receiving chatbot responses, all within a streamlined Streamlit application.

A Journey of Technological Exploration and User-Centric Design:
SOur development journey has been one of technological exploration and user-centric design. Experimenting with various AI models and frameworks, we've crafted AUTHRAX AI to stand at the forefront of conversational AI. Each step of the way, we've focused on understanding and addressing the needs of our users. This dedication has resulted in a chatbot that not only interacts naturally but also provides valuable insights from PDF documents, embodying innovation, efficiency, and a commitment to the user experience.
